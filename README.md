# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Features

- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a very simple and elegant syntax. It's much easier to read and write Python programs compared to other languages like C++, Java, C#.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language which means that it does not need to be compiled before it is run.
- **Dynamically Typed**: In Python, you donâ€™t have to define the data type of a variable while declaring it.
- **Vast Libraries Support**: Python provides a large standard library which includes areas like internet protocols, string operations, web services tools and operating system interfaces.
- **Platform Independent**: A Python program written on a Macintosh computer will run on a Linux system and vice versa. Python programs can run on any operating system.

## Installation 

Python can be easily installed. Visit the official site of Python https://www.python.org/ to install python.

## Usage/Examples

```python
print("Hello, World!")

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports these concepts.
