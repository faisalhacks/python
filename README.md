# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Features

- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a very simple and elegant syntax. It's much easier to read and write Python programs compared to other languages like C++, Java, C#.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language which means that it does not need to be compiled before it is run.
- **Dynamically Typed**: In Python, you don’t have to define the data type of a variable while declaring it.
- **Vast Libraries Support**: Python provides a large standard library which includes areas like internet protocols, string operations, web services tools and operating system interfaces.
- **Platform Independent**: A Python program written on a Macintosh computer will run on a Linux system and vice versa. Python programs can run on any operating system.

## Installation 

Python can be easily installed. Visit the official site of Python https://www.python.org/ to install python.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports these concepts.

## Explanation of OOP Concepts

### Class 🏗️
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods common to all objects of the class.

### Attributes 💡
Attributes represent the data members or properties of a class. They define the characteristics of an object.

### Methods 🛠️
Methods are functions defined within a class that perform operations on the class's attributes or interact with the object.

### Special Methods ✨
Special methods, also known as magic methods or dunder methods, are prefixed and suffixed with double underscores. They provide functionality for various operations such as object initialization, string representation, comparison, etc.

### Object 📦
An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the class's constructor and can access the class's attributes and methods.

### Inheritance 🧬
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy of classes.

### Encapsulation 🔒
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that manipulate the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary functionality.

### Polymorphism 🦄
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code by providing multiple forms or behaviors for objects of different types.

### Abstraction 🌟
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Abstract classes and methods provide a blueprint for other classes and methods to follow.

### Duck Typing 🦆
Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior rather than its inheritance hierarchy or explicit declaration. It emphasizes the importance of an object's interface over its type.
